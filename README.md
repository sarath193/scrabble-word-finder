# scrabble-word-finder

The project is intended to find all the meaningful words that can be found in a matrix of characters using HashTable, AVL Tree and
a LinkedList.

It can be seen that HashTable and AvlTree are almost toe to toe but linkedlist takes forever to finish running.

The program compares every possible combinations of words and search the words in a given dictionary.
